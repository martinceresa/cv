                  analysis technique that generalizes runtime verification
                  algorithms from temporal logics like LTL to stream monitoring,
                  allowing the computation of richer verdicts than Booleans
                  (quantitative values or even arbitrary data). The core of SRV
                  algorithms is a clean separation between temporal dependencies
                  and data computations. In spite of this theoretical separation
                  previous engines include ad-hoc implementations of just a few
                  data types, requiring complex changes in the tools to
                  incorporate new data types.",
