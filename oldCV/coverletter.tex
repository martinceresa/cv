I am writing to apply for the position of \position\, as advertised on your
website.
%
I am currently at the end of a PhD program, I submitted my thesis on December of
2022 and waiting for it to be reviewed.
%
The main area is theory of programming languages focusing on optimization and
formal verification.
%
I have a strong background on functional programming languages (\emph{Haskell},
\emph{Erlang}, \emph{Coq}, \emph{Agda}, \emph{OCaml}) and experience with
imperative languages like \emph{C}.
% I have been teaching the fundamental principles of
% compiler theory at the National University of Rosario, Argentina, and I planing
% to leave academia to work in industry.

% In your job posting, you mention that you want to hire someone with extensive
% experience developing production compilers.

Since I am about to finish my PhD in the area of Theory of Programming
Languages, I do not have much practical experience in real world problems.
%
However, the PhD process taught me to learn new concepts in short
time with ease, and I am extremely willing to and interested in
learning new techniques and languages.

On the web job posting, it is mentioned that the position should focus on
building efficient engines for the offchain monitoring.
%
I think I am an excellent candidate to fill this position based on my previous
works and collaborations on blockchain semantics as well as online transaction
monitors.
%
Moreover, from the point of view of formal methods, I can provide guidance and
interesting ideas coming from the area of static formal verification in which I
developed my thesis.
%
Finally, I find it challenging the idea of creating an \emph{efficient} engine,
subject totally new to me, and thus, I am very excited to work on the project.

%
% My skills are limited to academic necessities but I
% think they should be an excellent place to start.
% %
% % Since you also mention the language \emph{Python},
% % while I have no experience with the language, I have plenty with functional
% % languages such as \emph{Haskell}.

% When I saw the position opening, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to offer
% you my skills.
% %
% I know since I came from a theoretical bakcground and that I lack practical
% experience but I want to emphasize my eagerness to learn and to be part of a
% very productive team.

% Please feel free to email me. I hope to hear from you soon.

% In your job posting, you mention that you want to hire a Social Media Manager
% who understands Internet and social media trends. During my time at Young
% Living, I was given the responsibility of increasing follower numbers on
% Instagram. I explained to my manager that I would be happy to do so, and that I
% would also work hard to increase follower participation, because engagement has
% become an important metric.

% Within six months, I increased our followers by over 50 percent and increased
% engagement by 400 percent. I’m very proud of that accomplishment. Currently, I’m
% working to build a following with the best influencers in our niche.

% When I saw the job opening, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to offer you
% both my social media marketing skills and people skills. I’ve included my resume
% so you can learn more about my educational background and all of my work
% experience.Thank you for your time and consideration.

% \section{Research Statement}

% One of my main interest is functional programming languages.
% I think that we can use functional programming as a tool to
% understand how programming works, in particular pure functional languages give
% us the ways to explicitly observe what is going on, understand what we are
% observing, and build new concepts. It gives us the tools to think, create and
% test our ideas based in powerful mathematical concepts.

% I am working on a verified library in Agda to analyze costs models based on
% Category Theory. The main idea is to find a bridge between Improvement Theory
% developed by Andrew Sands and Functorial Semantics developed by Daniele Turi and
% Gordon Plotkin where I would like to build an improvement theory based on GSOS
% rules.

% My interest includes: functional programming, compiler theory, denotational
% semantics, generic programming, static analysis and type theory.
% I like Category Theory, abstract mathematical tools,
% and love Haskell.
